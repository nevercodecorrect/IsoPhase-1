# CVE-2020-15195
TensorFlow

SparseFillEmptyRowsGrad uses a double indexing pattern, It is possible for reverse_index_map(i) to be an index outside of bounds of grad_values, thus resulting in a heap buffer overflow.

```C
for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) { 
   // Locate the index of the output of the forward prop associated 
   // with this location in the input of the forward prop.  Copy 
   // the gradient into it.  Mark it as visited. 
   d_values(i) = grad_values(reverse_index_map(i)); 
   visited(reverse_index_map(i)) = true; 
} 
```
